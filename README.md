# Athena
 
Game and Engine with only C#

This repository contains a game engine written entirely in C# and a game created using the engine.

Most of the code used in the engine was written from scratch, with the exception of specific features like loading 3D model files (e.g., FBX) and GPU kernels, which were not implemented manually.

The game is a simple one where players control an airplane that flies through consecutive rings.

The name "Athena" was chosen because she is the goddess of wisdom, symbolizing the wish to excel in coding. :)
